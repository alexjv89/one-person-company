- We use obsidian to document stuff because
	- notes are in plain text files(markdown)
	- easy for AI to process - AI first workflow
- notes are synced with team members using git
	- why git?
		- easies to version control
	- individuals have a local copy of the files
	- make changes locally
	- sync the changes to a remote server 
		- so that others can consume your changes
	- 
## Instructions to sync changes
- overall 
	- pull changes from remote before pushing changes to remote
	- this minimises conflicts
	- conflicts only happen if more than one person is working on the same exact file
- instructions TLDR
	- right column -> source control
	- click on pull button - get the latest update from the server
	- select all the files with changes you want to share with others
		- click on plus button next to the file you want to share
		- click on the tick button (commit)
	- click on push button
	- if there is an issue - talk to alex.
