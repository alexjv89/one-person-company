- Thread around solo founders
	- 0 - 1 Million - main focus 
		- Revenue 
		- Overheads - outsourced
		- 
	- Why? 
		- personal taste? 
		- this is a new market that is created by AI
		- Time is limited
			- So I want to deal with less people. 
		- More and more work done by AI 
		- Single person company can become a billion dollar company
- What is the method to choose the problem to solve? 
	- Is Nikhil clear about this?
	- how will you be clear? 
	- methodology is based on 
		- case studies that you are exposed to. 
			- Darwinbox - lived experience - First 
			- Clay - 3rd party observations. from outside you are looking at clay
		- be a fast follower in different geography
			- pick the one that most exites us
			- unfair advantage
			- 
	- What activity will make this clear?
	- possible themes
		- replacing junior staff
		- fast following
		- low margin high quality saas products
			- R&D is cheap now
			- product like Darwinbox with some professional service
				- there is still time to make money from product
				- then shift to services. 
				- timing game - 
				- all saas companies will loose their margins - 90% to 30-40%
				- if we are playing this game, our systems needs to be build for 30% margin
		- Agency model
			- take accoutabilty
			- take ownership for outcome
			- automate internally
		- FDE 
			- 
	- criteria for evaluation
		- Are we pushing tech boundaries or are we pushing product/customer experience boundaries
		- Are we trying to solve an ephemeral problem
			- problem exists only for 3 yrs and we have to time our exit
		- solved by tech
		- towards fast following
			- vs breaking ground
		- what problems can be solved by AI 
			- now vs future - can be solved now
			- fully by AI vs supervised by humans-
		- frequency of task
			- has to be a daily or weekly problem
		- is this the top 3 KRI of the persona
		- The solution should be 10 times better than existing solution
			- e.g. replace junior developer with claude code
		- is this an opportunity to provide 
			- great data, - 3 points 
			- great domain expertise - 2 point or 
			- great software 1 point
