## Regarding the thesis of modular finance ops for the world
other industries where modularity plays out
- modular kitchen
- https://m5stack.com/ - this is IOT modules so that people can customise their IOT solutions. The solutions might be build by a consultant on behalf of the client or the client itself if they are DIY capable. 
- ikea - for individuals or business (airbnb hosts, co-working spaces)
- pallet racks, server farms
- transportation industry - shipping containers etc work on standards and modules

People like Alex - are the DIY kind
but for others - finance consultants(aka. finance controllers on internal payroll or outsourced accountants building client specific workflows) should be able to put together modules

this thesis is not "support ecosystem for single person companies" - related but not exactly that. 
this thesis - is "modular finance tools for the world"


## Modular vs integrated solutions
Integrated solutions - Apple, Ather, Notion - in fact most software solutions are integrated solutions. 

Integrated solutions wins where customer experience is highly required and customers are willing to pay a premium
Modular solutions wins when markets are sort of mature, customers are looking for flexibility/customisation, repeatability, easy of replacement(replacement or upgrade of submodules) and price flexibility.

e.g. apple laptops(premium pricing) vs linux/windows laptop(modular, expandable)

Assumption - overheads are not a place for premium experience but a place for utility solutions that are high quality and reliable at reasonable price. Moat - be the brand that people trust for high quality and reliable sub systems (e.g. belkin for power supplies). 

within the modular space - low cost products exists(amazon basics) and high quality brands exists(belkin).
