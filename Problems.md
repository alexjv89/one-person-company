## I want to ask questions to my financials

As a founder, I have a lot of questions regarding my financials. They can be categorized as 
1) business opportunity related
2) process adherence related
3) compliance related

Every founder will worry about one the above depending on industry, founder maturity, business maturity. 

Currently I ask my accountant for info. He takes time. Gets back to me with a report that has a lot of holes in it. I have more questions and this back and forth is very painful and I give up. 

Ease of asking questions is hard. This results in
- poor decision making
- poor process adherance
- poor compliance

typical response by CA for delay in reporting is that the books are not ready. When it is ready, there are mistakes, CAs follow a water fall process. They like to do one activity once. This means delays. 

### solution - data room
if users were able to ask questions to their data, no matter where they reside, no matter their state of completion, then founders can increasingly do the following
1) better decision making
2) better process adherance
3) better compliance 





# Unique insights

## features as products

everyone's perspective is finance is complex. No founder wants to touch quickbooks. They are scared that they will break something. No founder wants to give quickbooks access to 30 people in their team. They are scared their system of record will get spoiled. 

finance products needs to be simplified. finance products needs to be broken up, so that people feel like even if they spoil something it will not break the entire system of record. There is no calendly like or loom like products in finance. 

calendly and loom looks like features in a product. calendly could easily be part of hubspot(hubspot has a product for this). making products like this in finance space would make finance process more inviting for more non accounting users. 

e.g. having a seperate PO - purchase order system outside of zoho/SAP - means less learning curve, more customisation, etc for regular employees. This data can flow back into the system of record. Accountants can act as gate keepers. 

## cyclic process instead of waterfall process in accounting

Accountants like to reduce their work by making process waterfall like. First I will collect all transactions. then I will categoriise the transactions. while categorising I will ask the founder for details on a transaction - what did he pay 20k for?. Then I will do compliance work, then I will prepare the report and share it with the founder. Next month I will repeat the cycle again. 

There is a fundamental flaw with this approach. 
- transactions happen though out the month
- people who made the transaction remembers the nature of the transaction for 2 days max. if you reach out to me after 20 days, I dont remember the details
	- this results in lots of back and forth - between accountants and employees
	- this results in delays
	- this results in compliance costs 
	- this results in inaccurate reports
- accountants always complain that employees dont respond to them with clarification on time
- p&l head always complain that reports are full of errors and accountants dont do their job
- employees complain that all this back and forth is tedious. 

The root cause is that some parts of the accounting process needs to be done at higher frequency in a cyclic/agiile manager, not in a waterfall manner.
