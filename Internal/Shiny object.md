Alex generally gets shiny object syndrome. Working with Nikhil on a new thing is starting a new thing. Its the new shiny object. 

For a person who is observed to have shiny object syndrome, starting something new is the wrong idea. 

The right advice at this stage might be to continue doing what I was doing and dont start something new.
