audio recording - [[2025-10-07 - Call with Hari Zuna.m4a]]
## Transcript 

Bank statement thing or is it something else um it's more or less the same thing um I was just describing overall what are we trying to do um all right um but I think just check whenever we get time you can check that video later so okay it's actually not relevant to this uh conversation that much right um do you do you have something specific in mind for this particular call um no I was thinking it's better that you ask me the questions on uh how do we utilize the credit and that that part.

So I thought we create of for the call generally what you are saying us if there is that you are offering credits at it could be three things you're offering credits for free you're offering credits for discount and offering credits.

It's allments. A fourth there could also be expiring discounts expiring credits right?

So if there is free credits that expires, then what is a priority in which credits are consumed?

It's not necessarily first and first start, uh if it's an expiring credit.

I think that's the for When you say exp cricket, it could be accquisited.

Are you saying there is a fourth category or you know all the three, they are all expring?

I don't know.

So I mean, uh I thinkiring credits applies primarily to free credits.

See, when would I give somebody an expired credits, right?

Expiring credits is because I wanted them to use it as fast as possible. Um and uh and it's it's typically some promotion, right?

So it so promotion basically means it's it's definitely not going to be at full price.

So it's either free or at uh at cheaper price. Discount be selling at the normal price and then give a condition for expand because the nobody . Take care there may be permitations of combinations of the three without.

It's not a fourth category I within the three, maybe two of them as an experi and the third one does not unex, so it's cool.

So if you're saying middle just to open a spreadsheet . Hey, uh, before we get into those, don't you think uh uh do you understand what are we doing actually?

The is that relevant to those conversation?

I think it might be.

So I'll just take two minutes, okay?

So, uh so there's two, uh so there's two main concepts.

One is the finob bricks, finob bricks, what we are basically saying is. Um there's a bunch of these uh modules that we are building.

So you've seen this kit, right?

One second, let me share my screen.

huh? , right?

No, kit K. So let's say Bosh, uh Bosh kit, let's look first.

Yeah, something like this.

You' seen this tool kit, right?

So this tool kit so the kit has a bunch of these things, right?

It has hammer, it has aer, it has a drill, it has blah, blah, blah, it has a bunch of these tools and using these tools, you can actually do more or less whatever you want in the at your house. correct ? And then I want to make one more comparison between, let's say, um hammer versus nail gun, right?

And uh uh if you look at a hammer versus a nail gun, right?

So for example, this, right?

A hammer is a generic tool, a nail gun is a special purpose tool.

So if you want to put thousand nails, then this is the one that makes most amount of sense.

If you want a general tool that can be used for other things also, then the hammer is what you want.

Correct?

So with bricks, right, this this is what you're doing right now with finob bricks, we are building a bunch of these small tools, which together fit together like a like a bosh kit, right?

And each tool are our simple general purpose tools.

They not complicated tools are easy to use tools.

Okay.

So um something like zoob books or Quickbooks, right?

Is still too complex for four most people because most most founders or most people will they say, okay, you only handle it, I won't even touch it. Because you're scared of making mistakes.

Right um and it'll screw up your accounts and uh then there is traceable tissues and a whole bunch of these things, right?

But at the same time, like like money management as a as a fundamental concept, like everybody needs it.

So if you're basically saying from perspective, right we are building a bunch of these uh these small tools that fit together like like a kit That's whats and the transactions specifically is one of these things like like for example, a hammer, it's a general purpose, small hammer, but you can do a lot more things in let's say overbook or in quickBooks or there are more complex situations that that QuickBooks handles We are like not bothered it's meant for small businesses and it's actually meant for very specific hey you know what it's like a hammer you can do a bunch of things with it's right?

So that's fundam what we are trying to do.

So eventually if the transactions app is successful, then we want to build a bunch of other smaller apps also.

Like for example, we used to have the PO app, right?

And the PO app is also the same lesson that I learned from there also is like if you go to SP or some of these big tools, you have to buy all of their tools simultaneously.

Otherwise it doesn't ? So when a company becomes large enough, right, they will move out of these tools.

And that's fine.

No problem. Right?

It's not like we are trying to say that, hey, you know what people have to use the tools for the rest of the life.

No, that's not the case.

We are basically saying up to let's say five million dollars or let's say ten million dollars, you don't really need the complexity of uh uh of SAP. Like SAP is an extreme extreme scenario, but you could also argue same thing for let's say, uh, like exponent right exponent, they were doing about a couple of crores a month in expense management. Not a couple of cres, tens of crores per month on the PO tool for the last four years, right?

And now they' consolidated because now they they have regulatory constraints and blah, blah, all the data should be in one place right?

So makes sense.

People will migrate out maybe also the second argument is basically saying even if you have a primary tool right primary finance tool, there will always be a need for a secondary tool.

So the reason for the secondary tool is because you have a maker secular process, right?

Oh you are you have your transactions in zoe books, but how do you verify whether they are character or not?

So typically what people do people do their sheet Right?

So, so because we are a simpler tool, we can also be the second second tool in your tool chain.

Because primarily in finance, there is a maker checker process.

Your maker can eventually get migrated into something bigger, but I think we still have a scope for checker.

So this is broadly the game that we are playing.

Now these are all bun of very small small apps.

Like for example, PO is for purchase order management fet is like hey can I get data from multiple places into uh into spreadsheets so that I can this is something that I showed you before.

Now I've discussed I've I've depublished all these things.

I'm not publishing all these things.

I'm I'm going to the customer with transactions app first. When the transactions app is successful, then we will launch the rest of them.

But this is the idea.

The idea is we want to build these small small tools that you can independently use.

You can use transaction, not use use use transact app. Broadly we're targeting this small and medium businesses, but I think will mostly be targeting accountants. Right?

So it's it's a double-sided market, actually, honestly, um it will need some amount of marketing to the accountants, some amount of marketing to the founders.

Because, for example, some things are relevant to the founders, some things are relevant to the accountant. Right?

I think that's the way I'm looking at it.

For example, the fetch app is actually more relevant towards the founder.

I mean, it depends. Depends on the scenario, actually, to be honest.

Right?

For example, I'll tell you the case where we will market to the accountant for the transactions app, we we can base basically look at this as a subcontract from Zuna, right?

Um remember that'sensation totally before, um for just bank reconlation, what is the price that you would actually be willing to do if it's outsourced and done really well?

Right?

Now, if if that works out, let's say if if uh if it's actually more logical for you to outsource it to us and uh and we are able to do it faster, better, cheaper, more accurate.

And it's anyway, it's it's a mechanical process, right?

People, you will have to train new people and you have to keep the doing the same thing again and again.

It's a very boring work.

It's not intellectual work, right?

And it's the kind of work that software can automate.

So so I think that's the one so that's where we will actually directly talk to the account it is my opinion, right?

Because that way we can actually focus on small taskes . So I think this is the broad broad thing.

So we have I don't even know if this is a startup.

I'm just saying this is this is something that I want to finish I want to finish this project.

I don't know if a startup.

I don't know if it's a company.

I don't know if you're going to raise money or not. It be profitable, sustain business, but at least in my mind, it's too many broads that I want to finish this projects.

So I go through the trans the other day. What I was I I was very interested because coincidentally once in a year I do buy own books, which is to say, because what happens as a founder is I aut reimbursement Iplaying.

I pay something but client I have thousands of transsections.

You will be amazed by the transsections my back and and there no control of what's happening, and the way I track that is what I books of account, not forety, not for any other, but for myself.

And in that process, you won't really want to do essentially is to take I feel to go to my email, filter out card statements.

I have six cards then go to IOPD, password, merge it, do some XL to convert it to Excel, then use Excel filters, you know, and then good filters, whatever is my exper I don't care whatever is I try to play it back.

This is what I do it takes one or two days per year full day.

It's like I finish it.

I was doing that couple of weeks back I couldn't finish that.

I have to do it before this month I did it.

And then when it I, I have this written and I have to put my own statement and I added my downloads fold already.

Iloaded it.

I has a pass protected, which I haveload it up and it said it didn't work for me that time honest speak.

But the use is very real and this a personal individualized use, I' definitely sure company with more so an accounted form with help.

So the useills is no doubt and uh one thought I I added that I was for companies and accounting forms.

There's already a monkey keeping software that is doing this.

If lock there's one of more books can take all credit card statements, but reasonably well, it does for all In such cases, uh would you still work or would you not be necessary for some which would say the software?

So so so the accounting software is a crowded market, right?

There's enough enough number of players in it. Um I think we are sort of like an accounting software with a different positioning.

The positioning is basically saying we are modeler and atomic right?

Mod and atomic basically means that it's easier for the people to learn and use the tool.

People don't get overallant, right?

Even if you're not a finance guy and the the idea is we want to make it less scary for people to touch the tool, right?

So, uh and that's the reason why expon used a PO app for a long period of time.

Zobook had PO and they were paying for Zoobook.

Why did they use the PO to, right?

So the fund I was because they had what they had 350 people using the to.

It's easier to imagine 300 people 350 people having access over.

You'd be slightly scared, right?

Because will they affect the so it also creates a pet dish where if something goes, it stays in that place, right?

It doesn't it doesn't spill over.

So I think that's the way I'm positioning it.

I'm not saying it's like where it has GST plus all these things one fold thing involved, right?

It's not that.

Each of these are individual tools and individually you can explore things and set it and it will not spread over to other places.

I think that's the way I'm looking at it, right?

Which also means which also means that if you have if you have 300 employees, you only have to train them on the PO tool only like here is how you make purchase orders, right?

Because they don't care about how your accountants and how your reconsation is done or how budget is balanced all that stuff doesn't matter.

So I think I think that's the positioning.

We are basically saying it has to be simple and narrow enough for one particular thing, but collectively it works together as an ecosystem or you can pipe the data and do use it with theobbucks do whatever you want.

Right?

So I think that's the way you're looking.

So if somebody else has transactions are transactions and they're perfectly happy with them they will not use this.

I think that's the use case.

But let's say but like you said, if it doesn't support a particular transaction and if we support then then they'll end up using this as a temporary solution or maybe as a permanent solution, something like that, right?

So it can be part of the maker process.

It can also be part of the checker process.

So I think that's the way because your modeler, um, it could be part of your main process or it could be part of your hey, how do I verify how do I verify whether everything came correct or not? ? And this this this transaction categorize or it is just.

So, okay, so that's where I send you that video. My opinion yeah, my quickly share my video share my screen.

I just quickly walk you through that.

So, uh let's see.

I write it on.

Yeah.

So in my opinion, right, there are five levels. Um So first first level is where I you upload something and uh you will get the data in a single format.

You can download it, right?

Correct.

The second level is where hey you know what once you upload it can I see my bank account fluctuate?

So something something like this.

So this is what I used to do before, okay?

So you existing right?

I was tracking my daily bank balance in each of my bank balance and collectively summing it up and then doing a 30 day running average. Right?

So this will tell see this is not having all the details, but he'll still tell me that you know what my money is accumulating my account and then it's actually not accumulating in my account.

I can see the variations on a monthly basis this is how my spikes looks like on a monthly basis.

He'll give you some piece of information.

So this is this is like top level information for cash flow, right?

So if you have a simple account, like let's say, I have salary and I have take the salary and spread that money into different different places.

Then this is good enough. Right?

But if somebody gives me a loan, if I borrowed 10 lakh rupees from my friend or if I bought a mutual fund worth worth three lakhs, then that is hard to see here.

You can't see that here. . So this is level two.

This is in my opinion, this is level two.

Level two is like, I can visualize my bank balance and and gives me a good amount of insights or how to run my business or run how to run my life, right?

And uh the third level is where you visualize influ and outflow.

Influ and outlaw is like, I want to see what is what is my balance looking like?

One second, I'll show you this.

I closed all the tabs actually.

So it's there in the video. Um one second.

So if we look at this thing, right?

This is my cash flow.

So it's it's showing you showing me that oh, so much money came in and so much money went out.

But I don't know again, I still don't know whether it's actually so okay, one second, I'll just show you this first right?

So, there there's a lot of money that came in a lot of money that went out, but when you transfer money from your own personal account to your own personal account, that's called a transfer.

So transfer is not though, right?

It's just money moving within your own account. Right?

So if you spend the effort to categorize the transactions as transfer, then you have better insights in terms of inflow or flow. Right?

This this I would say is like the next level.

I can split up and see, oh, how much money came in on what day, right?

The the fourth level is where I specifically see all the details uh like this for example like this.

So now I I see income expense asset liability.

These are not accrual based by the way.

These are cash waste. Uh but cash based itself is good enough insights for you, even as a small business owner.

It's not good enough for tax filing. Right?

So now, but you have to put effort to actually categorize all these things, right?

Somebody has to do or is this income is it expense?

Is it?

So so this is where I'm actually calling out, okay, what is the out and what is the effort record to do that right?

Fifth the level is basically where I'm saying I will take the final level is where I will take the expense and I will specify who did I spend it?

I will label all the transactions so let's look at what labeling means, right?

Labeling basically means, I look at this, I identify the category, whether it's asset, expense transfer liability.

I identify I can I can put it in a particular category.

I can identify who did I pay this to?

So for example, if I paid you one lakh, I paid Hari or Zuna one lakh for accounting and it comes under expense right?

And I might write a comment here saying okay this isending payment for the last six months. ? So this level of this is the final level.

This is level five, where it's so much details, but it's a lot of effort. ? Now, different people require different levels.

Not not everybody wants the final level.

Some people they'll be happy with level three, good enough.

Works for me, I'm able to run my business, right?

So so I think that's where the credits come in.

Credits basically were basically saying we will charge for level one. Where you upload, we will convert into one format that will charge again, small trivial amounts, okay?

And then we will also charge for all of these efforts, which is categorization efforts.

So this could be via the roll engine.

This is where we'll use the roll engine and the AI combination and every time something is automatically categorized, which against the charge a small amount tiny amount. Right?

So so this is whatance app similarly for the rest of the app also we want to like so we want to do met bill.

We don't want to do subscription. Now in your previous question, right is it for an end customer is it for the business?

Sorry is it for accountants?

I think when we reach out to account, we basically say you know what let's say for example, we reach out touna and say, okay, can you outsource the work to us?

And basically you will say that the customer requires category and entity customer doesn't require comments or customer requires only this much level of effort.

We' say okay, fine that's how much we can actually do we can do it at scale.

How we'll decide on SP, right?

Like how frequently do you want it?

Do you want it to be updated on a daily basis, weekly basis, blah, blah, blah.

And then uh we'll do it on behalf of you.

And you can you can you can pass it on the customer or or like whatever is your your operational process with the customer you deal with that, right?

For an end customer, say for example, like your your use case that you mentioned, right for your personal purposes, they can also like sign up use the toll by themselves and then do a simple amount of simple categation so that it'll start working for them.

So simple toll, uh, but lots of general use cases, I'm sure there are much better tools than this for a dedicated purpose.

That's not the objective.

We want to be like we want to be like Excel sheet, but better than Excel sheet. Just wondering if this will learn and using the next time that I'm categorizing a particular amount as say salary I'm.

Next time it is salary.

I mean I'm hoping that is to do, is a small.

Theation is automatically detect whether it's a salary assigns that a salary. Because this is from bank statements, at least the data is reliable.

There's no way the data is wrong, right?

I think that's the I think I understood theis at least my my my thought process is that this will work really well for those clients or those people who don't have a bookkeeping system, modesty speaking.

For example, if you already have books or already have books, this would not help the accounted.

This might help the secondary check, if at all the found.

So you you want to maintain records.

I don't care about doing. Just want recur compliance oversight, but you want every day I want to do this will help.

It will help people like me who wants to do once once a quarter once I hear some personal stuff.

I could be a business.

It may not be. Is let's say, for example, we are doing accounting for alobies.

We already have quickbooks, Zo books set up in such situation, I don't have a need because Zob books andBooks goes one step further as of now.

It is synmed with the bank.

It pulls out data.

We can set up rooms, which does reasonably well.

And I think already there are EI based or whatever, which will know over the second timeus is the thing.

So, yeah, so I just want to be clear on that front.

Th though everyone else, right?

I mean, I think this will be useful for people who don't have a system. Like we ourselves have at least ten clients, maybe I can try that with you to be frank, where we do once in a year audit basically the client comes first for once in a year, they are private lifted hundred two hundred transactions a year.

The bank statement they will give they will to do whatever, then they may be charges with 30,000 for whatever it is What I have been doing from five years is it in sheet basically go through 200 transactions categorize it use that for use that for financial statements and some susseement and we use your um how efficiently if you can do I think we determine I'm spending two three days just not be my my team.

If you get uploaded because last year's categorization is already there 95% is a good point clients nobre for because if little manually, you don't want to pay for the title don't rep want it only for categ last year's bank statement row the last year's output fine, and this year's row data.

So the core is this year's output should be ready . This help me also the econom what price point would be a no?

Forget about how much what's a nobrainer at this price, though it's like it doesn't even make sense for me to put an employee to do this.

I think it will vary from plant to plant because the line items will be there.

So I want to go as cheap as possible so that like there is no reason to like not use it to Let me get back.

I don't have any number to the frank in my mind right now, right?

Um Let's say I don't know if it is that's why it is it is it is a company with say a hundred transactctions in a year in or 200 transactions in year.

My guys would adv max somebody who has studied last year would take less than I did for a fresher guy will do some Google that take one one day, right?

And my comparison, to be honest, is not with that one takeup cost. Like articles are available by fifteen thousand a month.

So I don't have to go over there, but that's like a low brainer for me.

So if it takes a 20, 25 days, fifteen thousand is the intern salary be paid you are saving one day of his work, one more intellecture or more things inside divide fifteen thousand by let's say twenty or twenty four thousand rupees I think at the max is what the ability There's a nobrainer for us because of course this means, I think to start with honestlyinety percent accuracy would payers, because I can still ask them to spend half an hour in check.

But over time if that can increase, that can help it increase into hundred percent then it opens up a lot for us.

But but not about it much.

I just from a reverse cost enough place to start with like more details would be more more interesting for sure I understand the Alab also.

I also don't think alab will actually ever use it.

I think that's not use that size view take smaller companies.

It's as big as ad.

We have clients who are pre-revenue but bigger bookkeeping software. Not useful you what, right?

I think you said, you had some other tools.

It's a classic example to discuss earlier and many other clients have there have two book instances or two, one you as one, right data into a oneace is a nightmare today.

There is no affordable tool, which can basically do a set of things replicably, pulled out the PL from both ones over books where the books wereed consolidated moved their company transactions. Gave me a give me a pluget play.

It cannot be the same format as it is in with books or.

Maybe I want it to be contensed or maybe I want a feature to double click and see why is the.

This this would be a game, but I'm sure this may be a part of your plan, but this can work for those who are had system.

So like have you said, you are tool, I mean, you are tool kit maybe large enough to cover for some problems faced by small people, some problems faced by other basis, some problems faced by somebody who does not have any system. . Makes sense.

So uh interestingly, one of the use cases that came up with uh exponent, um is uh they were also using Z books, but they were also doing cash-based uh budgeting.

So so what they were doing is they were verifying the payments against the PO. Um and so they used to take each payment uh transaction entry and uh and match it against the purchase order number and from the purchase order number match the budget budget ID.

This process cannot be done in so when these kind of workflows which are slightly out of the workflow that Zoebooks does, right?

I think that's where the general purpose tool can shine, but I think that's a long shot.

Like I don't know if that that that's very hard to sell because like I've seen it in exponent.

I haven't more of going to the product to see what is the issue I mean companies like them have always had a pain point, but the pain was only limited to them.

Like for example, they collecteds from their customers.

But if and I know very well that if I can sol for them, they'll pay for it.

But then there are no other players who have checks in today's step because they sell to university at schoolmes in the US, right?

I mean, so it feels like a very chall thing, but it's only for one two people for directing.

But generric like say consolation and pulling data and helping founders to use spreadsheet or a dashboard and see and I don't if it's actually possible because I don't know the tech of these.

There is Zo books completely updated.

There's quickbooks completely updated.

I am the wrong.

I don't want to go to both.

Even if I go to I can't and my mym is my bankann is runningow.

The only way Kaliano Barnabase can do today is either one pink is finas guy, he will reply tomorrow only.

And he also has to go through netpacking four times and for today, I would say, let's say for the last month end, you have to go to the books, export one balance sheet, go to the other books, export second balance sheet, add right, but say, and bank balance is an easier thing.

But let's say they want to know something else their role as complex complex I don are very valuable. Credits its. Credits will be for bricks.

You can use it for transactions use for something else, right?

One other things that I want to do is like similar to Starbucks, right?

I don't want to expire the credits if somebody has paid full price for it, right?

And uh um otherwise the credits stays and you can actually pay.

So the credits will be priced differently for US customers versus in Newman, like we be much cheaper in India, maybe slightly price different, right?

So, uh you did explain how to actually account for this.

The run the running average is the only thing that we didn't fully understand. Part is trying to say is if you're doing, let you gave 10 credits free of cost today, that makes share my screen I actually jarred Hey, by the way, just uh that uh the sample file that you uploaded, right?

Can you share the password?

I can also take a look at it and I'll write the password for . Credits to somebody and not collecting any money giving it for that has not use.s not.

So in case, in this month, obviously there is no revenue and there is no music.

It's you are giving two credits at 50% higher termsary terms, right?

And let's say they are using hundred credits in right?

So in this case, I think the question you are asking is what is revenue?

I was to say is there are obviously two ways it.

One is first in first out which says the hundred credits used are actually belonging to the free credits that I gave and hence I don't have any revenue this one.

Or at any point of time, you should have a wave crack the running balance of the credits and the cost paid for that credit. Running balance is credits reduced by those credits used this this minus this.

So which means end of number, I had 300 credits and not end of number actually, when the usage happened, I had 400 credits, but received cost of balance.

It is 200 divided by and. And in 400 it is hundred rupees is what you have got to give them 400 c. Hundred rupees is what I got in altether for the credits. End of total income total credits given is 400 credits hundred credits you for free and two hundred credits you give for hundred rupees.

So basically for every credit, you have got point to five rupees or for every rupee of revenue, you have given four credits out.

Now if they have the beginning of the month further now a month, it would be easier it is not all days if it would make it easier.

So then there's no opening and all that.

So then when that person used hundred credits on that day, by cost per credit draws point to five.

Hence, not cost by per credit.

Hence I can save if hundred credits were used, then this is Which means 300 credits are still with the customer 75 rupees is still in the Ford revenue.

And next month, let's say they areizing two hundred credits next month and say you're not next day you're not selling anything. Next day you're not selling any credits.

They are just utizing two hundred credits more than the rupees. of ue and the remaining amount are refunding to them, this is totally in. Not refronting that is getting expired then the expired thing also should get to that the same expert is good in the which it is.

Understood. Can you one line?

So let's assume day four, there is another two list Again bought at bought at hundred . Let's thatund the previous case, this might I brought in that to just say when the credits are being utilized until that date, what has been the average cost per credit, that number we need to somehow uh built into the system if we are not doing FIFO first in.

If you're doing FIFO, all this condition does not arise. 200 credits they are utilizing no you will be accized.

Next to 200 credits they are utilizing proportionately.

Let's say this is 120, then this proportion it will be against.

First infrastruct is very easy.

When you are doing average cost, then theuplight.

So this is just like how you are accounting revenue the other person has for cost, right?

And the standards of the logic is more driven from their side because they are paying hundred and let's say they are not paying anything here.

Should they account for any professional cost in the first day?

Or the second day when the hundred is completely a cost for them.

The cost is their fee for the average costs everything cups individual.

But anyway, I think we are also running short of time now.

Quickly we will do the F four.

You are saying hundred two hundred so credits opening battries itself is hundred hundred and you are releasing another two hundred, right refund and remove I'll forget about refund for now.

So 300 out of 400 has been utilized 75% ofvenue has been , which is three by four.rect now you saying pay credits is money in this two hundred. Four is 300 and opening is hundred addition is to hundred 300 cost to This is for the O andfficial this.

So I got whoify two hundred of this month two hundred and opening 75 already recognized so 25 rupees is spending to two25 is the receipt for which 1.

So now you tell me how much is you is very good example, right?

So this month itself I' released two hundred used two hundred God two hundred Still, my revenue will not be two hundred it would only be 155.

I see.

I see.

I see.

Because uh the two hundred used um out of this two hundred hundred is opening, which is coming at 50 or rupees car cost. Rupees cost and then underst.

Got it.

So because uh now I understood running balance. Running balance is actually running balance is actually it's to like, but if you that it's for me to explain it is not opening, not even growing, not even like an average.

It is when you are utilizing that credit, what is the cost you are pay in your average so far.

So that's the point you still have, if 200 roo day five opening is hundred at cost of something, but if it was a f first in first out, it was much different then this hundred would be inclic first and half the price and then the next hundred we built the full the price like that so it could have been very different.

What what is this uh this this thing called so that I can read it up a little more on this this is called creditbased accounting I don't think there's a technical uh uh accounting related standard of terminology. This is from either costing technics, which is averageverage cost, etcera.

That could be some that there for FIF FIF is not a statement that is the other form will cost in the, they can easily get approval saying that not spending for free is average cost then at the will be in in our case, is there a specific advantage if the revenue is delayed?

Because the cash still sits in the bank, taxes, if you're becoming profitable in this venture, is to say expenses are less and my income is good than you are deferring your revenual inter . Average card is might be accepted.

FIO is also not not that widely accepted, so it's not recommended generally because the logic case, the logic is you're not giving that free credits for actually free.

The one thing you to use it the next month and then by your paid credits.

Hence the real lend for it is one for the free ones, you have a revenue tactic in my is not that's the logic but you can always choose FIF or you can choose is not allowed in today's time to be used is cost.

Even then much in India.

This is pretty much I have to go when you, we can have one more at the activity.

For smaller amounts it difference in the doesn't much difference.

Ist.

To be honest this is very logical our logical is we can Okay..

I'll text to the password for that statement.

You see what can what you can do.

But actually, one more thing when it comes to statement is the statement is rubbish because it has so many logos, so many pictures.

The statement, you include some offers, some clear taxerrip photo.

I don't know how you will decor that, but all the district.

So this is one and the federal bank stuff you can send it over.

Thank you so much.
