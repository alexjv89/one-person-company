- Do one kind of task at extremely large volumes
	- this increases our margins
	- it helps us hire and retain talent
		- less switching cost for developers
		- address more corner cases
	- model is similar to stripe/razorpay
- e.g.
	- collect payments - 3rd party example
	- possible internal examples
		- categorize and label transactions
		- study the ledger and flag issues
- for this the ideal ICP is
	- [[Accounting firms]]
- why other ICPs dont work
	- Early stage founders - needs us to do too many things, we will not get narrow task at large volumes
	- Series B finance teams
		- possible needs to be visited
		- We still will have to deal with customer asking us to do multiple tasks
			- Not as severe as early stage founders,
			- there is still volume
		- We have to deal with tasks that are unique to that company. 
		- this should be attempted after we solve the problem for accounting firms - opinion
