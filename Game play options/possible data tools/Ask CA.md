Thing of this like a CA on chat - maybe whatsapp. 
- using the data tools we feed in information
- What are the typical questions that you ask from your CA 
	- is the GST filing done
	- What is the value? 
	- did everything go well with TDS? 
	- How much money did we pay with TDS?
	- Can you share an MIS for investor reporting? 
	- What was our budget vs utilisation for this month? 
- All these questions can be answered by the tool if the data tool is fed
	- all basic operation task status
	- basic filing details - date, values, etc 
- These are things that the CA does not have time for. 
- This should be done via whatsapp chat.
